# Cryptocurrencies
Module 19
#### Project Overview
   Using skills learned in this module with unsupervised learning, processing and clustering data, reducing dimensions, and reducing the principal components using PCA     to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to break into the cryptocurrency market. The client is a prominent investment bank interested in offering a
  cryptocurrency invenstment portfolios to customers. Before making this informed decision they will need an analysis and report to include what cryptocurrencies are on
  the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Since there isn't any known output we will use
  unsupvervised learning. We will use a clustering algorithm and visualizations to share the findings of this analysis.
### Deliverables
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA -applyndardScaler and fit_transform()
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA - apply PCA algorithm to reduce dimension of X Dataframe
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means - apply Kmean algorithm to predict clusters
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
